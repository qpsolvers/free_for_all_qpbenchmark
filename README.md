# Free-for-all test set for QP solvers

This repository contains quadratic programs (QPs) in a format suitable for [qpbenchmark](https://github.com/qpsolvers/qpbenchmark). It is [free-for-all](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/free-for-all#Noun), open to problems from all fields, hard and easy. Here is the report produced by the benchmarking tool:

- ðŸ“ˆ <a href="results/free_for_all.md"><strong>Free-for-all test set results</strong></a>
- ðŸ“ˆ [Dense subtest results](https://github.com/qpsolvers/free_for_all_qpbenchmark/blob/main/results/free_for_all_dense.md)

## Installation

The recommended process is to install the benchmark and all solvers in an isolated environment using ``conda``:

```console
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate qpbenchmark
```

It is also possible to install the benchmark individually by ``pip install qpbenchmark``.

## Usage

Run the test set as follows:

```console
python free_for_all.py run
```

The outcome, written to the `results/` directory, is a standardized report comparing all available solvers against the different [benchmark metrics](https://github.com/qpsolvers/qpbenchmark#metrics). You can check out and post your own results in the [Results forum](https://github.com/qpsolvers/free_for_all_qpbenchmark/discussions/categories/results).

## Contributing

Do you have quadratic programs to share? Join the benchmark by submitting it to this test set: open a PR (preferred), or complete the submission form:

- ðŸ™Œ **[Submit a new problem](https://github.com/qpsolvers/free_for_all_qpbenchmark/issues/new?template=new_problem.md)**

You can also contribute by running the benchmark on your machine and posting your results to the [Results forum](https://github.com/qpsolvers/free_for_all_qpbenchmark/discussions/categories/results).
