# Free-for-all test set for QP solvers

This repository contains quadratic programs (QPs) in a format suitable for [qpbenchmark](https://github.com/qpsolvers/qpbenchmark). It is [free-for-all](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/free-for-all#Noun), open to problems from all fields, hard and easy. Here is the report produced by the benchmarking tool:

  ðŸ“ˆ <a href="results/free_for_all_qpbenchmark_ref.md"><strong>Free-for-all test set results</strong></a>
</p>

## Installation

The recommended process is to install the benchmark and all solvers in an isolated environment using ``conda``:

```console
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate qpbenchmark
```

It is also possible to install the benchmark individually by ``pip install qpbenchmark``.

## Usage

Run the test set as follows:

```
qpbenchmark ./free_for_all_qpbenchmark.py run
```

The outcome, written to the `results/` directory, is a standardized report comparing all available solvers against the different [benchmark metrics](https://github.com/qpsolvers/qpbenchmark#metrics). You can check out and post your own results in the [Results forum](https://github.com/qpsolvers/free_for_all_qpbenchmark/discussions/categories/results).

## Submit a problem

New problems are welcome and easy to submit: send your code or save your problem to a file (*e.g.* using [`Problem.save`](https://qpsolvers.github.io/qpsolvers/quadratic-programming.html#qpsolvers.problem.Problem.save) from ``qpsolvers``), and send it via this form:
